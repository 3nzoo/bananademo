                <strong>Returns/Refund/Reprint Policy</strong>
                <p className="mt-2 text-justify small">
                  bananabanners.com focuses on providing our customers with the
                  best possible printing experience and products. If there is
                  any issue with your order, you must report the problem within
                  five (5) business days. You can submit your claim by calling
                  our Customer Service Dept at (888) 739-8501, Option 1 or via
                  email at info@bananabanners.com. Our Customer Service
                  Representative will document your complaint and create a claim
                  for you to reference as we investigate how to best resolve the
                  issue. All defects and/or order issues must be reported to
                  bananabanners, Inc. within 5 business days of receiving your
                  order. Customer will be requested to submit digital photos to
                  document the product’s defects. In some cases, customer will
                  be required to ship defective product(s) back to bananabanners
                  at their own expense and in an agreed upon reasonable time
                  frame. In cases where the order is required to be shipped back
                  to bananabanners at the customer’s expense, bananabanners may
                  reimburse the customer for shipping if a defect is determined
                  to exist. Any charges related to expedited orders, such as
                  rush printing or shipping, are non-refundable for defective
                  products unless FedEx delivers a defective product or fails to
                  deliver an order. Turnaround time and shipping options for
                  reprinted orders varies due to available production capacity
                  and are at bananabanners’s discretion. Turnaround time begins
                  after receipt of final proof approval. Final approval will
                  only be accepted in written format. No verbal approvals will
                  be accepted.

                  than the printed piece and the customer supplied proofs are
                  not calibrated to our presses.
